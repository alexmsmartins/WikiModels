This file contains a list of tasks to perform in WikiModels.

Tasks for WikiModels:
 - check if replacing null for Set is OK in wm_libjsbml
 - decide if mandatory fields should be made optional in a model. This decision would be in the spirit of a Wiki but,
 it would generate many incosistent models (ex: Species.compartment is mandatory in the SBML Specification)
