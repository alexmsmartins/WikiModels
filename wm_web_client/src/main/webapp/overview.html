    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kinetic model is a mathematical representation of the dynamics of the concentrations in a chemical reaction system. They are used in order to help relating the behaviour of integrated
physiological systems to properties of individual molecular components. These models are expressed as systems of ordinary differential equations (or differential-algebraic equations) relating instantaneous rates of change of the
metabolite concentrations to the difference between the rates of production and the rates of consumption of the metabolite
in point by each considered process in the physiological system.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In turn, the rate of each process can be described by a function of the
concentrations of various metabolites. These functions and the parameters that apply can be determined through experiments
<em>in vitro</em> using purified components or inferred from theoretical considerations. Large-scale models may include
hundreds of metabolites and processes. Because physiological systems are very complex, significant advances
in understanding each single process are obtained through a collective effort towards controlling many confounding factors
that may cloud apprehension of the process' properties. Thus, many mechanisms are unclear, several alternative rate
laws may have been proposed for each process, and several different parameter sets for each rate law may have been
determined. Each decision about what mechanisms, rate laws and processes to adopt in a kinetic model requires substantial
specialized expertise, must be thoroughly justified, and is open to scientific discussion.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a model is set up it can be used to
make predictions about dynamic behaviour of the variables, how each
concentration and rate of reaction responds to environmental changes, etc..
These predictions must be compared to experimental observations of the
integrated system that is being modeled. Eventual discrepancies may point to
inaccurate or missing knowledge about the processes under consideration and
suggest new experiments and/or refinements to the model.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussion above suggests that kinetic
models of complex biochemical processes should ideally be developed as a
community effort. However there are significant hurdles to an effective
community effort.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, model development requires close
collaboration between two main sub-communities with complementary skills.
Namely, modelers that must have strong computational and mathematical skills but
often lack the strong biochemical expertise to correctly interpret the
experimental results and select the best data, and wet-lab biochemists that have
the latter expertise but lack the skills that are necessary to make good models.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the timings and editorial
constraints of regular scientific publication are utterly inadequate for such an
endeavour.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there are presently no software
platforms that are effective for such a community effort. So far, most of the
effort of computational biologists was directed towards developing good
applications for setting up and analysing kinetic models,creating standards
(eg. SBML) to ensure portability of models among modeling platforms, and
creating model repositories.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These aspects are the great driver for the
WikiModels project.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having cleared the motivation behind the
project, the next issue to address is the problem statement itself.</p> <br />
    <ul id="list">
        <li>
            <p><b>The problem </b>- Not being able to construct kinetic
models in a communitarian fashion, both in the sense of sharing information and
in the design of the model itself. The fact that there is no effective way to
convey information and	build models in real time and in an iterative and peer
reviewed fashion. The distance between the people that participate in the
construction of a model. The difference in background between the groups that
may contribute to this task.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Who is affected </b>- Both experimentalists and systems
biology theorists when they try to work together in a model or set of models.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>The impact </b>- If the process of designing models includes
more then a reduced number of people, making peer review and collaborative work
becomes very difficult. The limit is not so much about not being able to do
share information but more about the time it takes to do it, the resources
necessary and the quality and pertinence of the information that reaches the
receptor(s).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>A successful solution</b> - Should enable the collaboration
by putting at the disposal of participants an use interface that allows them to
work on the same models and associated information. That solution should be
complete enough to enable the users to update the models and check other users
updates, simulate the models, comment them and share data in general with one
another. It should also make it easy to do so.</p>
        </li>
