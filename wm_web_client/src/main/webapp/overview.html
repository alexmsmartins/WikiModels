    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kinetic modeling is playing an ever increasing role in helping our understanding
    of biological processes. Many good tools for simulating and analyzing kinetic models are publicly
    available [1]. However, developing good models that can be reliably used by the community at large
    requires more than these tools. Namely, the following issues need to be addressed:<br /></p>
    <p><ul id="list">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Model development often requires engaging multiple parties
    (experimental and computational) in an iterative testing/refinement process. Thus, effective tools
    for distributed collaboration are crucial.</li>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Models always rely on some assumptions that are subject to discussion
    and eventual change. Thorough documentation of assumptions, underlying rationale, and discussions
    eventually leading to improvement are critical for effective development. Abstracted from this contextual
    information, models are prone to misinterpretation and of little use to third parties.</li>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Traditional publication in peer-reviewed journals is inadequate at
    conveying such contextual information, owing to space, style and timing constraints.</li>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Nevertheless, citability of contributions and credit tracking are
    important factors in productively engaging the community in a long-term effort.</li>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li>Finding the causes of discrepancies between model predictions and
    expectations, and generating hypotheses to explain/fix those discrepancies can be non-trivial. Tools
    to help in these activities are thus important assets.</li>
    </ul><br /><br /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WikiModels seeks to address these concerns. The current prototype permits editing,
    browsing and documenting models. Each entity (reactions, parameters, etc.) of a model can root threaded
    comments (discussion lists) thus enabling an open peer-review of each aspect. A unique immutable URL is
    associated to each element and comment, allowing external cross-referencing. Models can either be imported
    as SBML files and then commented in WikiModels or set up in WikiModels from scratch. Ongoing developments
    include tagging, a Wiki-like history for models and a Role-Based Access Control system. Later-on we will
    add functionality for online simulation and analysis, for model assessment and for automated hypothesis
    generation.</p>
