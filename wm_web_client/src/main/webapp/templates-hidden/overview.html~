            <h1>Overview</h1><br />
            <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kinetic model is a mathematical
            representation of the dynamics of the
            concentrations in a chemical reaction system. They are used in order
            to help relating the behaviour of integrated physiological systems to
            properties of individual molecular components. These models are
            expressed as systems of ordinary differential equations (or
            differential-algebraic equations) relating instantaneous rates of
            change of the metabolite concentrations to the difference between the
            rates of production and the rates of consumption of the metabolite in
            point by each considered process in the physiological system.</h2>
            <h2></h2>
            <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In turn, the rate of each process
            can be described by a function of the
            concentrations of various metabolites. These functions and the
            parameters that apply can be determined through experiments <em>in
            vitro</em> using purified components or inferred from theoretical
            considerations. Large-scale models may include hundreds of metabolites
            and processes. Because physiological systems are very complex, significant
            advances in understanding each single process are obtained through a
            collective effort towards controlling many confounding factors that may
            cloud apprehension of the process' properties. Thus, many mechanisms
            are unclear, several alternative rate laws may have been proposed for
            each process, and several different parameter sets for each rate law
            may have been determined. Each decision about what mechanisms, rate laws
            and processes to adopt in a kinetic model requires substantial
            specialized expertise, must be thoroughly justified, and is open to
            scientific discussion.</h2>
            <h2></h2>
            <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a model is set up it can be
            used to make predictions about dynamic
            behaviour of the variables, how each concentration and rate of reaction
            responds to environmental changes, etc.. These predictions must be compared
            to experimental observations of the integrated system that is being modeled.
            Eventual discrepancies may point to inaccurate or missing knowledge about
            the processes under consideration and suggest new experiments and/or
            refinements to the model.</h2>
            <h2></h2>
            <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussion above suggests that
            kinetic models of complex biochemical
            processes should ideally be developed as a community effort. However
            there are significant hurdles to an effective community effort.</h2>
            <h2></h2>
            <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, model development requires
            close collaboration between two
            main sub-communities with complementary skills. Namely, modelers that
            must have strong computational and mathematical skills but often lack
            the strong biochemical expertise to correctly interpret the experimental
            results and select the best data, and wet-lab biochemists that have the
            latter expertise but lack the skills that are necessary to make good models.</h2>
            <h2></h2>
            <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the timings and editorial
            constraints of regular scientific
            publication are utterly inadequate for such an endeavour.</h2>
            <h2></h2>
            <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there are presently no software
            platforms that are effective
            for such a community effort. So far, most of the effort of computational
            biologists was directed towards developing good applications for setting
            up and analysing kinetic models,creating standards (eg. SBML) to ensure
            portability of models among modeling platforms, and creating model repositories.</h2>
            <h2></h2>
            <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These aspects are the great driver
            for the WikiModels project.</h2>
            <h2></h2>
            <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having cleared the motivation behind
            the project, the next issue to
            address is the problem statement itself.</h2>
            <h2></h2>
            <ul id="list">
                <li>
                    <h2><b>The problem </b>- Not being able to construct kinetic
                models in a communitarian fashion, both in the sense of sharing
                information and in the design of the model itself. The fact that
                there is no effective way to convey information and	build models
                in real time and in an iterative and peer reviewed fashion. The
                distance between the people that participate in the	construction
                of a model. The difference in background between the groups that
                may contribute to this task.</h2>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2><b>Who is affected </b>- Both experimentalists and systems
                biology theorists when they try to work together in a model or
                set of models.</h2>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2><b>The impact </b>- If the process of designing models
                    includes more then a reduced number of people, making peer
                    review and collaborative work becomes very difficult. The limit
                    is not so much about not being able to do share	information
                    but more about the time it takes to do it, the resources necessary
                    and the quality and pertinence of the information that reaches
                    the receptor(s).</h2>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2><b>A successful solution</b> - Should enable the collaboration
                by putting at the disposal of participants an use interface that
                allows them to work on the same models and associated information.
                That solution should be complete enough to enable the users to
                update the models and check other users updates, simulate the models,
                comment them and share data in general with one another. It should
                also make it easy to do so.</h2>
